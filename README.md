## Features
1. Notification in chat only the source can see.
2. Discord Webook is all that is needed to connect to Discord and Fivem.

## Installation

1. **Download and Setup:**
   - Download the `Amezrial_StaffDuty` resource.
   - Extract the folder to your server resources directory. The path should look like `/resources/Amezrial_StaffDuty`.

2. **Modify `server.cfg`:**
   - Add the following line to your `server.cfg` to ensure the resource is loaded:
     ```
     ensure Amezrial_StaffDuty
     ```

## Configuration

1. **Discord Webhook:**
   - You need to set up a Discord webhook to receive notifications. [Follow these instructions](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) to create a webhook in your Discord server.
   - Once you have your webhook URL, replace `'YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL'` in `server.lua` with your actual webhook URL.

2. **Setting up ACE permissions:**
   - You need to add ACE permissions in your `server.cfg` to control who can use the staff duty command. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:
     ```
     # Granting the staff duty permission (replace group.staff with your role you want to use)
     add_ace group.staff "amezrial.staff" allow
     # Assigning the permission to a specific player or role
     add_principal identifier.discord:RoleID group.staff
     ```

   - Replace `RoleID` with the appropriate Discord Role ID or other identifier types according to your authentication method.

## Usage

- **Toggling Staff Duty:**
  - In-game, authorized users can use the `/staffduty` command to toggle their staff duty status.
  - Status changes (On Duty and Off Duty) are shown only to the source (person going on and off duty) in-game and sent to the specified Discord channel you chose in your webhook.
